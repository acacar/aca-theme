* My Color theme

   Is basically the [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][Leuven]], forked and lightly modified for convenience and taste. There is no need to be using this if you are not me, just go to the [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][original]] and if you like it consider donating to the original author.
